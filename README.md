Algorithmic Problems in Java
This project contains Java implementations of several classic algorithmic problems including:

Matrix search algorithms using both iterative and recursive approaches.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) for computing minimum distances in a grid.

Keyword dictionary editor with keyword detection, addition, and auto-completion.

0/1 Knapsack problem solved using dynamic programming.

Each algorithm is implemented with performance considerations and examples to demonstrate functionality.
